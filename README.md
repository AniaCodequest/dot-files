## .dot-files

My dot-files configuration. After using a forked version for a while I decided to start customizing my own version.

## Setup

Before reusing this configuration please update accordingly:

- [files/.gitconfig](https://github.com/colmarius/dot-files/blob/master/files/.gitconfig)
- [clone_and_link.sh](https://github.com/colmarius/dot-files/blob/master/clone_and_link.sh#L10)

## Usage

    bash <(curl -fsS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/colmarius/dot-files/master/clone_and_link.sh)

## Credits
